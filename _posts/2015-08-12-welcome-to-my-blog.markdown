Hi there.

I've been working on my [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) since the start of the year.  It's gotten me into using GitHub and all sorts of things I normally wouldn't be exposed to at work.  I've been trying many different blogging strategies but I really like GitHub and decided to give this a shot.

I'm primarly a Java developer during the day but really like the stuff going on around web development.  I am really starting to like JavaScript and what it can do these days with Node.js.  I think this is the future and I want to be there when it happens ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  All my information is in the footer.
