I dusted off my [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) today and looked around for some Python resources.  I remembered seeing some documentation from the various vendors that sell the Pi that it's great to learn Python on.  I am pretty sure this is for kids to learn and seeing how I'm a professional developer this has to be a walk in the park right?

Learning a new anything requries you to check your ego at the door.  No matter how proficient you are at similar skills you're going to stumble at some point.  That's okay.  I was able to complete all of the [exercises](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/python-intro/) but actually had to think a little bit on the very last exercise: compute the sum of all the digits of all the numbers from 1 to 1000.

This was an interesting exercise.  In Java or JavaScript using a brute force method it would not be elegant at all.  In Python I was able to do this in about 5 lines of code which were readable.  So far I'm impressed with the Python language and how it seems to give developers a lot of convenience for pretty common tasks: iterating over lists, splitting strings with tokens, joining lists, and the different types of casts.

I'm hooked.  Next up on my learning strategy: [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book).
