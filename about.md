# What's this about?
I started this blog as a way to give back to the global community.  I've been consuming content about software development for years from all sorts of people everywhere and it's one of the primary factors for my growth.  Over time as I've gotten more confident in my skills I thought I'd give back to this same community.

# Who is this for?
This blog is targeted towards enterprise software developers or anybody who builds full-stack applications that other humans use.  I tend not to go into mobile or embedded systems but I do have interests in those areas so there may be some content around that at some point.

I hope you, dear reader, will get new knowledge and in a painless way.  One of my personal frustrations is looking at a tutorial and not being able to complete it becuase it was worded incorrectly or it's outdated.  I'm going to try to introduce concepts as much as possible because the "new shiny" comes and goes but the overall process remains the same.

# A little bit about me...
I've been intrested in computers since kindergarten.  I remember vividly the day I got to play with an Apple *II*e and can trace my personal interest in computing technology all the way to back then.  I kept using computers to do word proceessing and play games.  I finally programmed them in high school.  Finally when I went to college I got my Computer Engineering degree at the University of Virginia only to find out that it is really an applied math degree which I had to really work at to grok.

Fast forward to now.  I've been doing consulting on-and-off the past several years and mixed some full-time jobs doing enterprise software development.  I love it.  I love solving real-world problems and seeing the fruits of my labor happen.  Our field is great because it seems our tools are always improving at a rapid clip.  There's always something new to learn and use.  I couldn't imaginge being in any other field!
